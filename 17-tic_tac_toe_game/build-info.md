# Frontend Mentor - Tic Tac Toe

![Design preview for the Tic Tac Toe coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹


- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Play the game either solo vs the computer or multiplayer against another person
- **Bonus 1**: Save the game state in the browser so that itâ€™s preserved if the player refreshes their browser
- **Bonus 2**: Instead of having the computer randomly make their moves, try making it clever so itâ€™s proactive in blocking your moves and trying to win

### Expected behaviour

- You can choose to make the default screen either the new game menu or the solo player game board. Note that we're using the solo player game board for the design screenshot, so if you choose the new game menu it won't match up in the design comparison slider. This isn't a big deal, but is something worth considering.
- On the new game screen, whichever mark isn't selected for the first player is automatically assigned to the second player when the game is started.
- The first turn of the first round is always played by whoever is playing as X. For every following round, the first turn alternates between O and X.
- After a round, if the player chooses to quit the game, they should be taken back to the new game menu.
- If the restart icon in the top right is clicked, the "Restart game?" modal should show and allow the player to reset the game or cancel and continue to play.

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the design file provided. We provide both Sketch and Figma versions of the design, so you can choose which tool you prefer to use. You can download the design file on the platform. **Please be sure not to share them with anyone else.** The design download comes with a `README.md` file as well to help you get set up.

All the required assets for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The assets are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized. Some images are reusable at multiple screen sizes. So if you don't see an image in a specific folder, it will typically be in another folder for that page.

The design system in the design file will give you more information about the various colors, fonts, and styles used in this project. Our fonts always come from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
